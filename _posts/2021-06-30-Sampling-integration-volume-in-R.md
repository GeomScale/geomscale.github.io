# Sampling, integration and volume computation in R

In this blog post we will compare several R packages with `volesti`.
[`volesti`](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation)  is a C++ library
for volume approximation and sampling of convex bodies (*e.g.* polytopes) with an
R  interface hosted on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=volesti).
`volesti` is part of the [GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io/) project.

The goal of this blog post is to show that `volesti` is the most efficient choice,
among R packages in a number of high dimensional computational tasks, namely:

* to sample from the uniform or a restricted Gaussian distribution over a polytope,
* to estimate the volume of a polytope,
* to estimate the integral of a multivariate function over a convex polytope.

In particular, we will compare volesti with:

1. [`hitandrun`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hitandrun), a package that uses Hit-and-Run algorithm to sample uniformly from a convex polytope.
2. [`restrictedMVN`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=restrictedMVN), a package that uses Gibbs sampler for a multivariate normal restricted in a convex polytope.
3. [`tmg`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmg), a package that uses exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with boundary reflections to sample from a a multivariate normal restricted in a convex polytope.
4. [`geometry`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geometry), the R interface of C++ library *qhull*. It uses a deterministic algorithm to compute the volume of a convex polytope.
5. [`SimplicialCubature`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SimplicialCubature), a package to integrate functions over m-dimensional simplices in n-dimensional Euclidean space.

## Comparison with hitandrun

Uniform sampling from a convex polytope is of special interest in several applications.
For example in [analyzing metabolic networks](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/13820/)
or [explore the space of portfolios in a stock market](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8732/).

`hitandrun` takes as input the linear constraints that define a bounded convex p
olytope and the number of uniformly distributed points we wish to generate
together with some additional parameters (*e.g.* thinning of the chain).

The following script first samples 1000 points from the 100-dimensional hypercube
$$[-1,1]^{100}$$ using both `hitandrun` and `volesti`.
Then, measures the performance of each package defined as
the number of *effective sample size* (ESS) per second.

```R
d = 100
P = gen_cube(d, 'H')

constr = list("constr" = P@A, "dir" = rep("<=", 2 * d), "rhs" = P@b)

time1 = system.time({ samples1 = t(hitandrun::hitandrun(constr = constr, 
    	n.samples = 1000, thin = 1)) })

time2 = system.time({ samples2 = sample_points(P, random_walk = list(
    	"walk" = "RDHR", "walk_length" = 1, "seed" = 5), n = 1000) })                
cat(min(coda::effectiveSize(t(samples1))) / time1[3],
    min(coda::effectiveSize(t(samples2))) / time2[3])
```

The ESS of an autocorrelated  sample, generated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling algorithm, is the number of independent samples that it is equivalent to.
For more information about ESS you can read this
[paper](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/sites/default/files/modules/Geyer-Introduction%20to%20markov%20chain%20Monte%20Carlo_0.pdf).
To estimate the effective sample size we use the package
[`coda`]([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda)).

The output of the above script,

```R
0.02818878 74.18608
```

shows that the performance of `volesti` is ~2500 times faster than `hitandrun`.

The following R script generates a random polytope for each dimension and samples 10000 points (walk length = 5) with both packages.   

```R
for (d in seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 10)) {
  
  P = gen_cube(d, 'H')
  tim = system.time({ sample_points(P, n = 10000, random_walk = list(
      "walk" = "RDHR", "walk_length"=5)) })
  
  constr <- list(constr = P$A, dir=rep('<=', 2*d), rhs=P$b)
  tim = system.time({ hitandrun::hitandrun(constr, n.samples = 10000, thin=5) })
}
```
The following Table reports the run-times.  

| dimension | volesti time | hitandrun time |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 10        | 0.017        | 0.102          |
| 20        | 0.024        | 0.157          |
| 30        | 0.031        | 0.593          |
| 40        | 0.043        | 1.471          |
| 50        | 0.055        | 3.311          |
| 60        | 0.069        | 6.460          |
| 70        | 0.089        | 11.481         |
| 80        | 0.108        | 19.056         |
| 90        | 0.132        | 33.651         |
| 100       | 0.156        | 50.482         |

The following figure illustrates the asymptotic in the dimension difference in run-time between `volesti` and `hitandrun`.

## Comparison with  restrictedMVN and tmg

In many Bayesian models the posterior distribution is a multivariate Gaussian
distribution restricted to a specific domain. For more details on Bayesian inference you can read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics).

We illustrate the efficiency of `volesti` for the case of the truncation being the canonical simplex,

<center>
$$\Delta^n =\{ x\in\mathbb{R}^n\ |\ x_i\geq 0,\ \sum_ix_i=1 \}.$$
</center>

This case is of special interest and typically occurs whenever
the unknown parameters can be interpreted as fractions or probabilities.
Thus, it appears naturally in many important
[applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6884588).

In our example we first generate a random 100-dimensional positive definite matrix. 
Then, we sample from the multivariate Gaussian distribution with that covariance
matrix and mode on the center of the canonical simplex. To achieve this goal we first 
apply all the necessary linear transformations to both the probability density function and the
canonical simplex. Last,  we sample from the standard Gaussian distribution restricted to 
the computed full dimensional simplex and we apply the inverse transformations to obtain
a sample in the initial space.

```R
d = 100
S = matrix( rnorm(d*d,mean=0,sd=1), d, d) #random covariance matrix 
S = S %*% t(S)
shift = rep(1/d, d)
A = -diag(d)
b = rep(0,d)
b = b - A %*% shift
Aeq = t(as.matrix(rep(1,d), 10,1))
N = pracma::nullspace(Aeq)       
A = A %*% N #transform the truncation into a full dimensional polytope
S = t(N) %*% S %*% N
A = A %*% t(chol(S)) #Cholesky decomposition to transform to the standard Gaussian
P = Hpolytope(A=A, b=as.numeric(b)) #new truncation
```


Now we use `volesti`, `tmg` and `restrictedMVN` to sample,

```R
time1 = system.time({samples1 = sample_points(P, n = 100000, random_walk = 
    list("walk"="CDHR", "burn-in"=1000, "starting_point" = rep(0, d-1), "seed" = 
    127), distribution = list("density" = "gaussian", "mode" = rep(0, d-1))) })

# tmg does not terminate
time2 = system.time({samples2 = tmg::rtmg(n = 100000, M = diag(d-1), r = 
    rep(0, d-1), initial = rep(0, d-1), P@A, P@b, q = NULL, burn.in = 1000) })            

time3 = system.time({samples3 = restrictedMVN::sample_from_constraints(
    linear_part = A, offset= b, mean_param = rep(0,d-1), covariance = diag(d-1), 
    initial_point = inner_ball(P)[1:(d-1)], ndraw=100000, burnin=1000) })   
                  
# print the performance (effective sample size over time)
cat(min(coda::effectiveSize(t(samples1))) / time1[3],
    min(coda::effectiveSize(samples3)) / time3[3])
```

the output of the script,

```R
30.3589 3.936369 
```

Now we can apply the inverse transformation,

```R
samples_initial_space = N %*% samples1 + 
   kronecker(matrix(1, 1, 100000), matrix(shift, ncol = 1))
```

Allow us to conclude that `volesti` is one order of magnitude faster than
`restrictedMVN` for computing a sample of similar quality.
Unfortunately, `tmg` failed to terminate in our setup.

## Comparison with  geometry

Next comparison is about volume computation of convex polytopes.
It will help us to understand the need of randomized computation in
high dimensions implemented in `volesti`.

`geometry` is considered as the state-of-the-art volume computation package
in R today but also on of the most efficient package for volume computation in general.
To compute the volume `geometry` deterministically build a triangulation of the
input polytope that can grow exponentially with the dimension.
Thus, inevitably, such an implementaion will end out of memory at some point.
For more details about the volume algorithms in `geometry` you can read
[*qhull* documentaion](http://www.qhull.org/).

First we make the comparison in dimension 15,

```R
P = gen_rand_vpoly(15, 30, generator = list("body" = "cube", "seed" = 1729))

time1 = system.time({geom_values = try(geometry::convhulln(P@V, options =
    'FA'))})

time2 = system.time({vol2 = volume(P, settings = list("algorithm" = "CB",
    "random_walk" = "BiW", "seed" = 127)) })

cat(time1[3], time2[3], geom_values$vol, vol2, abs(geom_values$vol - vol2) 
    / geom_values$vol)
```

In this dimension, using `geometry` is more efficient than `volesti`.
This happens because the dimension 15 is a relatively small dimension and the
`geometry`'s run-time does not yet explodes. Let us continue with an example in
20 dimensions to see how this picture changes.

```R
P = gen_rand_vpoly(20, 40, generator = list("body" =  "cube", "seed" = 1729))

time1 = system.time({geom_values = geometry::convhulln(P@V, options = 'FA')})
```

and then, we have a run-time error,

```R
QH6082 qhull error (qh_memalloc): insufficient memory to allocate 1329542232 bytes
```

Which means that `geometry` fails to compute this volume due to insufficient memory allocation.
On the other hand, the same instance can be approximated by `volesti` in a few seconds,

```R
time2 = system.time({ vol2 = volume(P, settings = list( "seed" = 5)) })

cat(time2[3], vol2)
```

The output is,

```R
23.888 2.673747398e-07
```

Hence `volesti` is the only way to estimate the volume of high dimensional polytopes in R.

## Comparison with  SimplicialCubature

Computing the integral of a function over a convex set (here, convex polytope)
is one of the oldest [mathematical problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration)
and is important for many [scientific applications](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0025797).

In R the package `SimplicialCubature` computes multivariate integrals over simplices.
For the general case of a polytope one way to go is to compute the [Delaunay
triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) with package `geometry` and then use the package
`SimplicialCubature` to sum the values of all the integrals over
the simplices of the triangulation.

On the other hand, `volesti` can be used to approximate the value of such an
integral by a [simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo integration method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration),
which employs the volume of the polytope, say P, and a uniform sample in P.

In particular, if we want to compute

<center>
$$I = \int_P f(x)dx .$$
</center>


we sample N uniformly distributed points from P and,

<center>
$$I \approx vol(P) (1/N) \sum_{i} f(x_i).$$
</center>


The following script generates random polytopes for dimensions d = 5, 10, 15, 20
and defines the integrand function f.
Then computes the exact value of the integral of f over each polytope using
`SimplicialCubature` and `geometry`.
In the sequel, we approximate that integral with `volesti`.

```R
for (d in seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 5)) {
       P = gen_rand_vpoly(d, 2 * d, generator = list("seed" = 127))
       tim1 = system.time({ 
           triang = try(geometry::delaunayn(P@V))
           f = function(x) { sum(x^2) + (2 * x[1]^2 + x[2] + x[3]) }
           I1 = 0
           for (i in 1:dim(triang)[1]) {
               I1 = I1 + SimplicialCubature::adaptIntegrateSimplex(f, 
               t(P@V[triang[i,], ]))$integral
           } 
    })
    tim2 = system.time({ 
        num_of_points = 5000
        points = sample_points(P, random_walk = list("walk" = "BiW", 
            "walk_length" = 1, "seed" = 5), n = num_of_points)
        int = 0
        for (i in 1:num_of_points){
            int = int + f(points[, i])
        }
        V = volume(P, settings = list("error" = 0.05, "seed" = 5))
        I2 = (int * V) / num_of_points 
    })
    cat(d, I1, I2, abs(I1 - I2) / I1, tim1[3], tim2[3], "\n")
   }
```

and we obtain the following results,

```R
5   0.02738404    0.02446581    0.1065667   0.023    3.983 
10  3.224286e-06  3.204522e-06  0.00612976  3.562    11.95 
15  4.504834e-11  4.867341e-11  0.08047068  471.479  33.256 
20  halts         1.140189e-16  -           -        64.058
```

Notice that the pattern is similar to volume computation.
For d = 5, 10 the exact computation with `SimplicialCubature` is faster
than the approximate with `volesti`.
For d = 15, `volesti` is 13 times faster and for d = 20 the exact approach
halts while `volesti` returns an estimation in about a minute.
The reason is that the run-times of both the computation of the Delaunay
triangulation with package `geometry` and the exact computation of the
integral with `SimplicialCubature` grow exponentially with the dimension.
On the other hand, the run-time of `volesti` grows polynomially with the dimension.

## Conclusions

In this blog post we compared `volesti` with five R packages in certain
challenging computational problems:

1. sampling from  polytope,
2. volume computation of polytopes and
3. computing the integral of a function over a polytope.

We found `volesti` faster in all cases as the dimension grows.
Especially in the cases where the exact algorithms halt
(for dimensions larger than 20), `volesti` takes a few seconds or minutes to
estimate the desired quantity. The reasons behind this success is the efficient
geometric random walks implemented in `volesti` and the fast
randomized approximation algorithms for volume computation.
