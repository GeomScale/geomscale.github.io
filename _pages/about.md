## What we aim ?

*GeomScale* is a research and development project that delivers open source code
for state-of-the-art algorithms at the intersection of data science, optimization,
geometric, and statistical computing.


The current focus of *GeomScale* is scalable
algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration,
convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to
fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art
theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations.

We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions
in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and
statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools.

*GeomScale* aims in serving as a building block for an international,
interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical
and statistical computing.

## Scientific background, problems and applications

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/boltzmann.png){: .align-left}
The main computational problem is **sampling** from high-dimensional distributions.
Sampling  is a fundamental operation that plays a crucial role across sciences
including modern machine learning and data science.
We work on the development of practical algorithms based on sampling for a
set of fundamental computational problems such as **convex optimization**,
**integration** and **volume computation**.

Regarding applications GeomScale project provides an efficient geometric algorithms
for estimating high-dimensional copulas that are useful in **computational finance**,
in particular financial crisis prediction.
Moreover, GeomScale hosts a software framework for **analysis of metabolic networks**
that given a metabolic model generates high-dimensional random sampling of
metabolic fluxes that in turn provide an unbiased description of the capabilities
of the metabolic network.
